        <attribute name="use-for-extraction"/>
        <a:documentation>This attribute is to identify which transcription file should 
          be used as the default or canonical file from which expression level should be extracted. 
          Likewise, all other transcriptions files should mirror this file in structure and xml:ids </a:documentation>
      </optional>
      <optional>
        <attribute name="hash"/>
        <a:documentation>This attribute is used to indicate whether the transcriptions is a fixed file, 
          with unique hash (an IPFS hash should be used) or if the file is the working head of a version history. 
          If the later the keyword "head" should be used. The definining characteristic of a transcription file designated 
          is that it does not refer to file with specific content that can be hashed, but to the most recent version of a 
          transcription chain. Thus a file designated as "head" cannot take a "hasSuccessor" attribute.
        </a:documentation>
      </optional>
      <optional>
        <attribute name="name"/>
        <a:documentation>
          The value of the name attribute must be unique, as it comes to represent the unique id 
          of the this particular transcription. If the transcription is not designated as "hash=head" 
          it is recommended that the hash be used as the name, but in all cases a name is required. 
          If the transcription is designated as "head" 
          the name can be anything but must be unique within the scope of the manifestation it is a transcription of.
          The assumed and default name is "transcription". The default is recommend, 
          because the naming of transcription "head" files 
          can be coordinated across SCTA items, so that all the transcriptions for a given sections can be grouped together.
          For example: the default transcription of distinction 1 for a given manifestation, could be automatically 
          be assumed to be the aggregate of every child transcription with the name "transcriptions". In the case of "head" 
          transcription, if no "name" attribute is given, the name "transcription" is assumed.

        <a:documentation>
          The "isTranscriptionOf" is used to associate a transcription to a manifestation. 
          The manifestation slug must be used that corresponds to the manifestation slug 
          associated with the expression in question

        <attribute name="canonical"/>
        <a:documentation>Canonical identifies one transcription per manifestations as canonical 
        or the default transcription. Normally, the transcriptions designated as head 
        should be identified as canonical.</a:documentation>

        <attribute name="hasSuccessor"/>
        <a:documentation>If a non "head" transcription is a previous version another transcription, 
        this should be indicated using the full SCTA resource id of that transcription. 
        This, in effect creates a version chain, for a given transcription</a:documentation>

        <attribute name="versionNo"/>
        <a:documentation>A version number can be associated with a non-"head" transcription. 
        Version numbers should always be less than the number of an associated successor transcription</a:documentation>

      <optional>
        <attribute name="language"/>
        <a:documentation>The language of a transcription can be indicated with the language attribute 
          following ISO 639-1 Language Codes</a:documentation>
      </optional>
      <text/>
      <a:documentation>The text value of the transcription should be file name of the "head" transcription file name</a:documentation>
